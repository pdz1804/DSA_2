By doing this assignment, we can use C++ to perform lots of advance programming skills such as:
- Design Patterns and OOP Techniques.
- Some Data Structures: Huffman Tree, AVL Tree, Binary Search Tree, Heap, ...
- Some Algorithms: Caesar Cipher (Encode and Decode), Sortings, Searching, ...

# How to run this Assignment Locally
- This assignment is recommended to run on WSL.
- Using the command "wsl" on the CLI to open WSL terminal.
- There are 20 input testcases in folder /input/, you can test each one in main.cpp file by specifying the relative path for "fileName" variable.
- "compile_ALL.sh" is a file that check the file "restaurant.cpp" compilation: it checks for all the possible errors and warnings.
- "compile.sh" will compile your "restaurant.cpp" file and run it, the output will be put in "output_submission.txt" file.
- To run "compile_ALL.sh" or "compile.sh" file, just enter "./file_name.sh" in your WSL terminal.
- There are also 3 python files: they are the generated-testcase file for general-purpose testing.
